# Hi, I'm Sage! 👋

I am a passionate technologist, fanatical about full automation and self-healing. I believe that I'm not in IT to fix something when it's wrong &mdash; I'm in IT to build things in such a way that I don't _need_ to be there when it goes wrong. If you do it once, it should already be automated before you need to do it twice.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 I currently work for a Fortune 200 company, having been in IT for nearly 30 years.
- 📝 I love history and have a niche history site, focusing on the little-known history a nearby city.
- I'm an Eagle Scout, with my Eagle project focusing on the history and cleanup of a small, local Civil War cemetery that was long neglected.
